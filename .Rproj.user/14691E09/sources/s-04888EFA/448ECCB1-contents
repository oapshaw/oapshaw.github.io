#### Welcome to my personal website!

I am a third year PhD student at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/) in the Criminology and Criminal Justice Program, and I work in the [Center for Violence Prevention and Community Safety](https://cvpcs.asu.edu/). I broadly focus on policing and program evaluation. Specific interests include policing and public health, particularly opioid related issues.

##### **About**
I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/). 

##### **Research interests** 

My research broadly revolves around policing, public health, and technology. Specifically, I examine the role of police in addressing public health challenges, with a particular emphasis on the opioid crisis, as well as the adoption and effectiveness of technology in police departments.
